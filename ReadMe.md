## **Financial Math GUI**

### **Overview**  
This project was developed with the goal of creating a **modular, user-friendly GUI** in Python to assist actuaries studying for the **SOA FM (Financial Mathematics)** exam. It combines my knowledge of **financial mathematics (FM)** with software development skills to create a practical tool for the actuarial community.  

In addition, I aimed to implement the **Model-View-Architecture (MVA) design pattern** to ensure a modular and maintainable system outside of an academic context.  

### **Current Functionality**  
- **Net Present Value (NPV)** calculator  

### **Future Plans**  
My goal is to expand the tool to include **additional financial mathematics functions** relevant to the SOA FM exam, creating a comprehensive study resource for actuaries.  

This is a work in progress, and Iâ€™m excited to share the progress made so far.
