## Financial Math GUI

The goal of this project was to learn how to create GUI's in python, use my FM skills, and create a cool tool to assist actuaries studying FM. 
I also wanted to utilize a MVA design pattern to create a modular system outside of an academic setting.

This is a work in progress, I want to share what I have so far. 
This is a simple GUI for financial math calculations.
Current Functionality:
- NPV

My intention is to add most functions related to the SOA FM exam.
